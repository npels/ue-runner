Directions:

- WASD to move the player around
- Left mouse button to attack
- E to interact with objects that have an exclamation mark appear above them

Goal: Defeat all the enemies in each of the three areas without dying.

Tips:

- The Armorer NPC can change the type and element of your attack
- Different enemies are weak/resistant to different elements

All assets used in this game were either created by me solely for use in this game,
or included in the starter content that UE4 provided.
 
This is my very first time learning and using Unreal Engine, so some portions of
the game may be awkward and it is very unpolished. I had to significantly constrain
the scope of the game to give myself time to learn everything I needed and I can
guarentee that, if I were to do something like this again, I could use what I've
learned to create a much better game.
